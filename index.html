// [1] May you find true joy my dearest lost and eternal love -- nay stolen, by those who fed you vapes and empty, false joys of The Emptiness Machine. I will never, ever, not for a single day not miss you.

C.S. Lewis, grieving the death of his wife, Joy:

"On the other hand, ‘Knock and it shall be opened.’ But does knocking mean hammering and kicking the door like a maniac? And there’s also ‘To him that hath shall be given.’ After all, you must have a capacity to receive, or even omnipotence can’t give. Perhaps your own passion temporarily destroys the capacity.

For all sorts of mistakes are possible when you are dealing with Him. Long ago, before we were married, H. was haunted all one morning as she went about her work with the obscure sense of God (so to speak) ‘at her elbow,’ demanding her attention. And of course, not being a perfected saint, she had the feeling that it would be a question, as it usually is, of some unrepented sin or tedious duty. At last she gave in—I know how one puts it off—and faced Him. But the message was, ‘I want to give you something’ and instantly she entered into joy."

// [2] Max explains precisely how sometimes you can “fail” (more precisely, be crushed by those who feel threatened) because you are RIGHT, not because you are wrong. Fiberhood Networks focused exactly on the part of the technology that would be of the most enduring real value, and that is why we failed during the pump and dump of the .com bubble. https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/s/djkgzynfJH
