            "In the fall of 1917, I entered Haverford College with two strings to my bow – facility in Latin and a sure foundation in mathematics. I "honored" in the latter and was seduced by it. That winter Rufus Jones called me in. "Warren," said he, "what is thee going to be?" And I said, "I don't know." "And what is thee going to do?" And again I said, "I have no idea; but <strong>there is one question I would like to answer: <em>What is a number, that a man may know it, and a man, that he may know a number</em>?</strong>"<br />
            He smiled and said, "<strong>Friend, thee will be busy as long as thee lives</strong>." I have been, and that is what we are here about." &mdash; Warren McCulloch</p>
